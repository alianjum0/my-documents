### Important Notes & Caveats:
*   **Estimates:** All driving times and costs are estimates. Actual times depend on traffic, road conditions (especially mountain passes), border crossings, and stops. Costs (especially entry fees and accommodation) are based on current (2024) information and trends, projected for 2025; they **will vary** based on specific choices, booking time, demand, and season. Please verify current prices and opening hours before your trip.
*   **Bookings:** It is highly recommended to book accommodation and popular attractions (like Postojna Cave, Plitvice Lakes) well in advance, especially for travel during peak season (summer).
*   **Flexibility:** This is a suggested itinerary. Road trips with toddlers require maximum flexibility. Be prepared to change plans based on naps, mood, and energy levels. Build in downtime.
*   **Toddler Needs:** Pack accordingly – snacks, drinks, familiar toys, carrier, travel potty, first-aid kit, sun protection, layers of clothing (mountain/cave temps vary). Plan drives around nap times if possible. Identify playgrounds or parks at each stop.
*   **Navigation:** Use a reliable GPS or map application. Download offline maps as cell service can be spotty in mountains or rural areas.
*   **Weather:** Check weather forecasts frequently. Alpine weather can change rapidly. Pack layers, rain gear, and sun protection.
*   **Vignettes/Tolls:** Remember you'll need highway vignettes (toll stickers) for Switzerland and Austria, purchased at the border or beforehand online. Slovenia also uses a vignette system (e-vignette). Italy, Croatia, and potentially France/Switzerland tunnels have tolls. Research the specifics for each country before you go.
*   **Currency:** You'll be using Euros (€) in Italy, Austria, Slovenia, and Croatia. Switzerland uses Swiss Francs (CHF). Credit cards are widely accepted, but carry some cash.
